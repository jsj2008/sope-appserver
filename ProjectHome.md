The SOPE package is an extensive set of frameworks (16 frameworks, ~1500 classes) which form a complete Web application server environment. Besides the Apple WebObjects compatible appserver extended with Zope concepts, it contains a large set of reusable classes: XML processing (SAX, DOM, XML-RPC), MIME/IMAP4 processing, LDAP connectivity, RDBMS connectivity, and iCalendar parsing. The parts of the package can be used stand-alone (e.g. in Cocoa applications) and do not require the appserver parts. For MacOSX developers, the package includes SOPE:X, which contains special Xcode and Cocoa support for SOPE.
